I am a first-year PhD student at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/), where I work with [Aishwarya Ganesan](https://aishwaryaganesan.github.io/) and [Ram Alagappan](https://ramalagappan.github.io/) at the [DASSL Lab, UIUC](https://dassl-uiuc.github.io/). I am interested in Distributed Storage Systems, with a focus on *designing and building* high-performance systems tailored for the modern datacenter environments. 

In the past, I interned at the Systems Group at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) where I worked with [Dr. Akash Lal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/akashl/) on applying concurrency testing techniques on production-scale distributed systems. 

I graduated with a Dual Degree (BTech + MTech) in Computer Science & Engineering from [IIT Madras](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/), where I worked with [Prof. Kartik Nagar](https://kartiknagar.github.io/) on cutoff-based techniques for verfiying distributed protocols.
